# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR THE EVSCOPE PIPELINE
#
# File: pipeline.conf
# ==============================================================================
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. This file defines all necessary paths, executables, and reference files
#    for the EVscope analysis pipeline.
# 2. Ensure this file is located in the same directory as the main script
#    (`EVscope_professional.sh`) or specify its path using the `--config` flag.
# 3. All paths should be absolute.
# 4. The variable `${EVscope_PATH}` is used as a base for most other paths to
#    simplify configuration. You only need to set it once correctly.
